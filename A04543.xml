            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In this head they charge them / that they walke not herein 1. according to the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les doctrine. 2. according to the practise of the primitive Churches: ād hereto they alledg the Scriptures for proofe: Now let vs try this point / remembering the question betweene these is (not about having of Elders / or of the execution of the office / which both of them agree in / have and practise / but) about the change / or continuāce of elders and let vs see / if (as they say) the Apostles have left such a doctrine / and the primitive Churches so practised: and here let the reader take the Bible in hand / and<note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39 Acts. 17.11.</note> search the Scriptures by them alledged. The first is Rom. 12.4.5.6.7.8. In which verses, he shall plainly see a generall exhortation / that no man arrogate to himself / but that he be wise and vnderstand according to sobriety: and a speciall exhortation to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful / that whether they be members / or whether they be officers / they be faithfull to vse the giftes God hath given them to Gods glory / ād the<note n="‡" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.7.8.10 11.</note> mutuall help one of another: but as touching the maner of choise of officers / or how long or short time they shal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their offices there is not the least mention: and therefore so far as I see / this place neither alloweth the one / nor condemneth the other.</p>
            <p>The second place of Scripture is 1. Cor. 12.11.12. etc. tēding to the same end / ād per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading them by the same similitude of a body to a right vse of the graces and gift
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13951:45"/> they had received / that the superior should not despise the inferiour / that the inferiours should not envy the superiors / but that all should seeke the furnishing and edifying of the body / whether they were mēbers / or whether they were officers / seing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were / or whatsoever they had / it was from<note n="†" place="margin">ver. 4.5.6 7.</note> one God / one Lord / one spirit / one giver / etc. And therefore all to strive for the good of the body / whereof they are<note n="‡" place="margin">Per. 27 Eph. 5.24. to 30.</note> members for their parte. Now as touching mentioning of any time / how long the elders are to continew in office / or that they may not yearly be changed (this place no more proveth it then the former: and therefore alledged and stretched further then the place wil beare.</p>
            <p>The third place is Act. 20.17.28. which I wonder they would alledg to this end: for though it be there said / that the Apostle called the elders together / and that he charged them that were overseers to be faithfull / yet there is no mention that the same elders continued from yere to yere / or that there was no chāge: The reader shal easyly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this: so that it proveth no more for their / then for the dutch Churches practise.</p>
            <p>The fourth place is 1. Pet. 5.1.2.3.4. where the Apostle vseth the generall name elder (by which name also in some respect he calleth himselfe) vnto them who were<note n="♣" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> special elders labouring in the worde / and doctrine / feeding the flock of God / as true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors / and these he exhorteth to performe their dueties not as of constraint / but willingly not for filthy lucre / but of a redy minde / not as Lordes over their fellow elders and brethren (als which I take to be comprehended in the word <hi>(Cleroon)</hi> translated in our tongue / Heritage) but that they should be ensamples to the flock: that so whē the chiefe shepheard should come / they being found<note n="†" place="margin">Ier. 23.28 1. Cor. 4.1.2</note> faithful stewards and shepheards might receive the crowne of glory: But to prove out of those wordes (not to speak of the controversy about the meaning of that place / or about the name of clergy ād layity which superstitious popish people seame to gather from thence) I say to prove out of those wordes that the Apostle there gave doctrine / or that the true Churches so prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised / that ruling elders and deacons might not yearly be changed / but must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new / is very farre fetcht. And though an argument may be drawen from the fourth verse that Pastors continuing good examples to their flock in vpright<note n="‡" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.12 Tit. 2.7.8.</note> doctrine and Godly conversation / may continue all there life / til Christ appeare: yet to reason that therefore inferiour officers must continew / and that it is a breach of Gods ordinance to change / is to farr stretched: and in my judgment to alledg this and the former pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for proofe hereof / is as if Maiors or Constables should alledg. Rō. 13 1. to 7.1. Tim. 2.2.3. Tit. 3.1 / 1. Pet. 2.13.14. that seing they are Gods ministers / sent of the King / and chosen off the people / they therefore might challeng that there ought to be no change / but that the Apostles shew these things to belong to the King / and so they still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew as the King / and not yearly to be changed. Now if any should thus alledg these Scriptures / I doubt not but all men would condemn them as stretching the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to far / and presuming to vnderstand above that is meete. Wherefore I exhort my brethren to deal more<note n="♣" place="margin">Prov. 21.20.21 Eccle. 12.9 10. 1.

            <p>But to these proofes they ioine and will vs also to see Numb. 8.24 / etc. Wel / let vs harkē also herevnto (as being redy in all pointes to yeeld to due proofe out of the olde Testament / where it agreeth and is not<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 8.13. with 2. Pet. 2.19</note> abolished by the new) The place sheweth that God commaunded Moses concerning the Levites / that from five and twenty yere olde and vpward they should go in to execute their office in the service of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the congregation: and after the age of fifty yeare they should cease from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their office / ād should serve no more. This is the effect of the place / and thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their exhortation have we seene it / but we cannot hence see / that they may conclude that elders should continew for ever and that it is a breach of Gods ordināce yerely to change them / because the Levites were so to continew: for then they must 1. proove that either this law was moral / or a type of elders in the new Testament. 2. that as<note n="†" place="margin">Numb. 1.47. etc. and 2.11.12 13.40.41.</note> Levites so elders are from their birth appointed to their office. 3. that they

Studley / who is now elder being above fifty yere must cease from his office.</p>
            <p>And thus have we searched and considered these proofes: but we cānot finde or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude out of them that any certaine time is sett downe how long or how short time el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may continew in their office ād therefore we dare not with thē so<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 12.26 27.

               <hi>As in some of these this Pastor ād Dan. Stud. do much agree with M. Horne and M, Chā. namely, that they likewise know how fond geare their cautions are which they bring to colour their choise of Apostates into office; how

            <p>The hinderance and hurt which I have observed to come as from other causes / so from the want of publishing these trobles in due time / and of the keeping of them in secret being printed hath beene one cause to move me to publish these things / that if God vouchsafe reformation in England the people may have care / not to let their Ministers be as Lordes over them but that the brethren and congregation holde their power in observing Christs ordinance to give their<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 13.7.17 / 1 Thes. 5.12.13.</note> Pastors and elders doble honour when they rule wel / and when they<note n="†" place="bottom">Der. 20.

            <p>IN the yeare 1594.<note n="†" place="margin">By their excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications ād vrgings to print they force me to relate these things fore against my wil: so that if things (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete to be repeated or named) be related let the vrgers rather then the vrged be blamed. 1.

T. B. was not a fitt match for him: Wherevnto he answered him / that though he were very lothe to contrary him (having heard how farr the matter was proceeded in / ād knowing how<note n="‡" place="margin">That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve I alwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es found / that my brother could never endure to be contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me / though I had never so iust a cause / and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came to practise the same as in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and in that which followeth doth / and wil appear.</note> hardly he could endure to be contraried) that yet he durst not but tel him his minde / and shewed him in the letter / that the reasons were many why he ought (in his iudgment) to leave of his desier in that behalfe and not to proceed / he being prisoner for the Ghospel / striving for sincerity in the eies of all men and she being much noted for pride / which would give great offēce / if he should marie such a one / and it should not be reformed: adding other reasons also / which I thinke not meete to be named or printed (except he force me further in his boasted answer / and wil have his nakednes more discovered) This of pride I onely name / as having beene the ground and cause of all these trobles: vpon the said reasons I exhorted and requested him rather to enquire / and think of some other / the marijng of whom might be without iust offence.</p>
            <p>He returned answer againe / some of the reasons he answered / others he did not / but with sharpe and hoate wordes (in stead of āswers) sought to<note n="♣" place="margin">Isa. 29.20.21.</note> make G.I. yield vnto him: Herevpon some letters passed betweene them: but at length / it appeared / that he was so<note n="*" place="margin">The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de inveigled may seame harsh / but I cā prove it / if they vrge it and some grounds thereof I dave tolde him privately / if he think thē not sound / let him name / and take them away in his answer.</note> inveigled / and overca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the said M. T. B. that no reasons or requests (howsoever he pretended to aske iudgment) could persuade him to the contrary neither would he minde any other / though he were tolde and much vrged / that if he maried her / many offences would follow / which all of vs by lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table experience have found / and what offences wil yet follow / who knoweth?</p>
            <p>And here (by the way) let all pastors teachers / and brethren (especially being vnder the crosse) be exhorted admonished / how and with whom they ioine themselves in that<note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> honorable estate of mariage that God the<note n="‡" place="margin">Gen. 2.20. to 25.</note> ordeiner and first celebratour thereof be not dishonoure: the truth reproched the hearts of brethren grieved and the mouthes of men without iustly opened against them: all which have fallen out by the pride of this Pastors wife.</p>
            <p>In the same yeare / about the moneths called August / or Septemb. (so far as I remember) the said M. Tomyson Bois comming to visit G.I. prisoner in the Fleete / after some speaches had / G I. desiered her / that / if his Brother should proceede to mariage with her (as it seamed he would) s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee then would reforme her self in her apparel according to his estate and calling: she then promised / that if they maried / she would do / as became his estate: at which answer G.I. much reioiced / ād thanked
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13951:49"/> her / that shee tooke his request in such good part / as she then in wordes seamed.</p>
            <p>Within few weekes after / the Pastor <hi>M. Fran. Iohnson,</hi> (having liberty to go abrode with a keeper) came to his brother in the Fleete / and tolde him / that he purposed to mary the said <hi>Mris. Bois:</hi> demaunding / if he could shew any cause / why he should not. G.I. answered / that he had written vnto him his minde / and shewed him reasons / as also noted of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences / that might arise therevpō: so that he thoght he ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede therein: then they fel into conference about the reasons: at length the Pastor waxed so short / and hoate / that he said he might do it without G.I. his consent: true (said G.I) you may / ād I tel you but my minde / you demaunding it of me: and in conclusion he said he would proceede: to which G.I. said / that he then would pray God to passe over the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / and to give a blessing if it were his will: and so they parted.</p>
            <p>Shortly after they proceded in mariage secretly: she againe comming to visit G I. was in more garish / and proud apparel / then before he had seene her: he againe dealt with her / that she would reforme it: she againe gave him good wordes: yet comming afterward he saw no amendment / wherevpon he was now the more earnest with her / they being now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. But she now changed her answer (taught I fear by her husband) and said / that if G.I. could prove them to be vnlawful by the word of God / she would leave them: he perceiving this dealing in her / so to chāge her former wordes / to<note n="†" place="margin">Ier. 2.5.6.20</note> dissemble / and not keepe promise (<hi>like the</hi>

               <hi>sonne, who said he would go, but did not</hi>) was much grieved / and yet he proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to prove vnto her by the<note n="♣" place="margin">Rom 12.2 1. Tim. 2.9.10. 1. Pet. 3.2.3 4.5.</note> scriptures / that such apparel became not a Pastors wife / specially he being vnder persecution: in prison: and often looking for death / but she would not be persuaded: and so for that time shee parted: the next time she came / G.I. stil dealt with her / and shewed her now from<note n="*" place="margin">Isah. 3.16 17.18. to 24.</note>
               <hi>Isah the Prophet, that the daughters of Zion were rebuked for such like things in their age:</hi> but she shifted it of / that hers were decent / and that all the creatures of God were lawfull to the children of God: which G.I. hearing / and perceiving that she had now learned moe shifts to cover these things / he was very sory / ād much greved / being also ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest with her / he shewed her that proud apparel and fashions of worldly dames were not decent in a Pastors wife: that the creatures / though<note n="†" place="margin">1.

            <p>At length it comming to be known / that they were maried / the <hi>Pastor</hi> was clapt vp close prisoner againe by the <hi>Archprelat of Canterbury</hi> for marijng in prison / and not after their vnlawful / superstitious / and popish maner: the keepers also were commaunded not to suffer her to come at him. It comming thus to be knowne vnto all / that they were maried / ād she being mett in her apparel vnreformed / it was most grievous / and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to heare what reportes and speaches were given out about <hi>M.

I hope your questions in your note are hereby the former things answered / both what to do with these vaine attires / and how to provide other. And whereas you speak of keeping her stock / I pray both you and her to looke vp to the LORD: rest vpon him: and provoke him not: see that your hearts be vpright / and that desier of riches creepe not into you.

               <hi>Now before I procede therto, let me here (as also in some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the discourse) crave leave of the Christian reader to set dovvne, what I have observed in their dealing: and let not my enemies be offēded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13951:56"/> thereat. First in this their dealing I observe their cunning in leaving the olde matter, and controversy, for which G.I. had meditated ād provided to answer, and to seeke and make new accusations, which he had not thought of, thereby the more craftily and easily to entrapp him: A devise and cunning it is, vvhich I feare (besides many other) the Pastor and M. Stud had learned by the examinations of the adversaries, whose suttelty vsually is, not to handle the matter in question, but to carpe at circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, seeking matter of advantage and accusation therefrom: an olde practise of those Hipocritical Pharisees,</hi>

Secondly I observe their suttelty, in the beginning to catch ād entrapp a man in his wordes or cariage, thereby to troble his minde, distemper his affections, and quel his spirit, that so being not able on a sudden advisedly to answer, ād fully to take away all their cavils, they may disgrace him, and make him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the people, whereby having gotten as it were halfe a victory, they make him also to fal in his iust cause, if the Lord by his</hi>

The P. at length said he would deale against G.I. for three things: that he was a nouris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her of tale bearers: a slaunderer: ād a teller of vntruths: he answered / those were great wordes / and asked him / if (being not able to disprove the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of Ier. 3.3.) he now devised new accusations: ād wished the elders to marke his dealing.</p>

               <hi>As then, I desiered the elders, so now I request others also who reade these proceedings, to observe this and such like their dealing.

                        <p>Against Mr. Stud. for fayling and flinching / as Mr. Settel did: for reviling mee: for becoming of a reprover of sin / a coverer and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the same: of a stander forth against evill / an accuser and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the reprovers of evill: for stirring vp the Pastor to contention / ād breaking of peace etc.</p>

                        <p>Now you knew I had these things against you / so that I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there could not be a worthy receiving / neither could I ioine with you in this action there being not a seeking of reconciliation.

                        <p n="2">2. A secound ground is from 1. Cor. 11.18.20. there are contentions and divisions in the congregation / so that thus to eat / is not to eat the Lords supper. And therefore I durst not to ioine with you. The divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not onely about the former matters / but the Elders wold also have broght in two Apostates to be in the office of deacons: and have dealt very hardly with them that with stoode them / accounting them contentious / slaunderers etc.</p>
                        <p>Also there is division about Maister Slades going to the Dutch Church.</p>

                        <p>Yea since even the Elders themselves have seene the inconvenience of their dealing / and at length told him / that they admonished him for declining<note n="♣" place="margin">They v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at lēgth the very word (decli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning) which the foure or fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve brethren shewed to be M.

                        <p n="3">3. 2.

                        <p n="1">1. After agrement in the eldership that the Pastor and I should write he was earnest that agrement might be kept / and that as the Pastor so I might write / but the Pastor being earnest and sharp against him he ceased: this is condemned 1. Thess. 5.23. for it is to suffer the spirit to be quenched: Revel. 2.25. It is not to hold fast to the end.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thogh a man may see and hear by his speaches privately that he greveth at these dealings / yet wil he not speak openly to help<note n="♣" place="margin">Iudg. 5.23.</note> against the mighty in battel / but rather ioineth with thē / and pronounceth that which my accusers and the offēders (whom I have reproved) set down against me. This is condemned. Isa. 8. and 51. which forbiddeth to fear mens faces or to ioin in confederacy with such: also 1.

Prov. 12.17.19. 2ly. touching proofe. He answ. that 1. he proved it by his confession to M. Adams in private / 2. by his recalling and otherwise expounding of it in the open congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. 3. he offered to write that he falsly alledged it / but the P. and E. commaunded G.I. silēce and would not suffer M.A. to answ. the sillogisme.</note> confessed his fault in misalledging Math. 26. (about the false witnesses) against me / and now he denieth it / so that he is stil guilty of two sins / first of falsely charging me that I falsefied her wordes / as they did Christs: for the witnes witnessed the very wordes which I wrote / so that I did not so much as wrest them / which worde <hi>(wrest)</hi> they now vse in their new accusation: which I desier may be observed: for so their former accusation falleth / yea they in their consciences knowing that I falsified them not vse now the worde <hi>(wrest)</hi> thereby thinking to have advantage against me / but even therein also they were overtaken: for I vsed the wordes which were tolde me / wresting them not one way / or other. Secondly M. Ainsw. is guilty of falsely charging G.I. that he falsefied her meaning / for he dealt not at all with the meaning of them / yea when the Pastor wrote to him / and asked if she so meant in her heart he answered / that the meaning he left to God who knew her heart / and he admonished her of the speach: thus far was he from falsifyng it / that he would not meddle therewith: so as M. Ainsw. with them becometh a false accuser while (to please them as I fear) he would seam to prove G.I. a false witnes: whereof I admonish him to repent / and to mark that his own waies come vpon his own pate.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. His negligence and weaknes: for (so far as I can remember) he promised me to deal against the attire / but to this day. I could not have him to ioin with me therein / thogh I earnestly desiered him: this condē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 1. Tim. 4.1. 2. Tim. 2.15. where commandemēt is givē to teachers that they teach / exhort / improve / and rebuke with all authority.</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:13951:94"/>5.

                        <p n="6">6. In the eldership when the Pastor vsed most bitter revilings (which are<note n="†" place="margin">Page 56.</note> before noted) I desiered him as also the other elders to admonish him thereof / but neither he nor they would: likewise when the P. spake most lasciviously and filthily in the congregation / and said he wold teach it in doctrine / he rebuked him not. This condemned 1. Tim. 5.21.22. Psal. 93.5. and 119.158. Ier. 23.9. etc.</p>

Ains. compleined that he saw they so caried things / as either the P. would be gone / or G.I. must be excommunicate which (said he) I cannot in conscience consent vnto: for (thogh witnesses fail him / yet) I have seene the apparel / and know the things to be true wherwith he chargeth her: ād said he / if the pastor wil be gone / let him / the Lord wil provide: thus he<note n="♣" place="margin">Herewith also I have vrged Mr. Ainsw. ād he denied it not neither would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: so that his silence bewraied a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science.

            <p>Dealing further with M. Sl. why he ād M.A. were so violent against me / he said that the P. and specially M.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ery / that none were such ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as M.

Thus by these devises they seduced the teacher and M. Slade an elder / and so with the like (it is very likely) they also deceived M. Settel / M. Leigh / and sundry others / as also at length the whole congregation / making them of frends enemies to G.I.</p>
            <p>I desier the reader to mark this dealing / and consider if profane men could have dealt more vnconscionably behind a mans back then these elders did: yea the very heathen Philosophers condemn such dealing / and yet it may be that in their boasted answ. they wil seeke to cast a cover over this their dealing. Wel / the Lord he saw it / and hath now discovered their vnchristian and (I doubt not but I may iustly say) vngodly dealing / for by such devises have they oppressed vs / and broght their purposes to passe / and I am persuaded if ever they write against<note n="‡" place="margin">Their own answ. to M.H.

Deut. 16.18.19. They shall iudg the people with righteous iudgment: wrest not the law: neither respect any person. Acts. 26.16. sheweth that the accused oght to have place to defend himselfe concerning the crime.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The elders suffered the Pastor my brother being a party in the controversy to be my iudg and to commaund me silence / they also drew the congregation to suffer this also: and how can I then looke for an equal end / when mine accuser is party / witnes / and the chefest of the Iudges in his own case? This condemned by the former places / as also by Acts. 19.38.39. and 23.30.35. and 25.16. Yea in the cause that we professe when we have by the counsell bene referred to the prelates who were parties in the controversy / and that they satt as Iudges what have we found? have not prisons / gallowes and banishments bene their chefest arguments / and our rewards at their hands? and if we be stil so referred / must we not looke for the same? and wil not the Pastor confesse it in his conscience to be vnequal? and yet he in his own case will be cheefe speaker and iudg: excommunicatiō also is his vtmost argument / and they have it almost as hasty as a prelat hath a prison. Wel / faith and patience must stand forth / and overcome both. Revel. 2. and 3. and 13.10. and 14.12.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In the eldership both the P. and his wife scoffed and reviled me: the elders reproved them not / neither would / being requested / yea they soght to cover and daub it vp. This condemned Lev. 19.17. 1. Pet. 2.1. with Eph. 4.29. and 5.4. and the elders suffering the reprovers of pride and sinne to be scoffed and reviled / <note n="‡" place="margin">Ier. 5.31.</note> what will they do in the end / and what wil be the end thereof?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. When the P. went about by sillogismes to deceive me / the elders would not help me therin / but M. Ains. laughed / and willed me to passe it over: this is condemned as in 2. Chron. 19.9. where faithful dealing is commanded: so also in Ezec. 34.4. where they are condemned for not helping and strenthning the weak: and sure in such cases when a Pastor seeketh to excommunicate his brother / a teacher ought not to laugh. Isa. 28.22. he rather should mourne. Ier. 9.1. etc.</p>

(as since is come to light) hereby dissembled and tooke Gods name in vain: for himself had confessed inough to M. Sl. concerning her pride / of which see in p. 184. and yet he thus dissembleth contrary to his own conscience. Thinketh he that the Lord seeth not his dealing? thogh he dissemble with men yet God is not mocked Gal. 6 7.</p>
                           </note> great dishonour that came to

This their coldnes / negligence or fearfulnes is condemned Revel. 2 and 3. Thou hast a name that thou livest but thou art dead. Isah. 59.4. No man contendeth for truth. Ier. 9.4.5. Trust not in any brother / for every brother wil vse deceit / and every frend wil deal deceitfully: and every one wil deceive his frend / and wil not speak the truth.</p>

In the eldership when they could not get their wil about Ier. 3.3. then they raised vp thre accusations / ād therewith not prevailing / they broght in three other / and at length vrging G.I. with many things augmented them to thirty accusations or articles / and broght them to the congregation (as is noted in the second offence) but would not grāt me a copy of them to consider of. This their gathering of accusations / carping / catching / and seeking advantages at mens wordes is condē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Isah. 29.21. They made a man to sin in the worde / and tooke him in a snare that reproved in the gate. Ierem. 5.26. they lay waite as he that setteth snares / they have made a pit to catch men. Luke. 11.53.54.

Amos 7. and Iohn. 18.28. etc. Mat. 27.11. etc. the chief priests ād elders persuaded the governour and the people to do that which they desiered / setting a smooth glose vpō their action. If he were not an evil doer (say they) we would not have delivered him vnto the: these also after the like maner persuaded the people that if G.I. had not beene contentious / a false accuser etc. they would not have dealt against him: and having now got the people to their bent / they cover their dealing by the title<note n="†" place="margin">Ier. 7.4. etc.</note> of the Church / that the Church would not excommunicate him if he had not deserved it.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Their discouraging and rebuking the reprovers of sin: covering and as it were pleading for sinners. This is condemned Levit. 19.17. Where we are commanded plainly to rebuke sinne. Revel. 3.19. which exhorteth to be zealous. Isah. 29.21. Amos 5.10. Which cry out against the discouraging and hating of them that rebuke sins.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Their promise breaking / not giving a copy of the proceedings as they had promised. Condemned Rom. 1.30. it being there reckoned among the grevousest sins. Psal. 15.4. promise keeping is one property of the godly: and what then is the breach? 2. Tim. 3.3. such promise brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are foretold of. Yea civil honest men would not so deal / and in civil controversies men grant copies of the procedings: and should elders
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13951:98"/> then in a true Church deny the like benefitt? But how greater then is their fault to break it / having before promised it? If their deedes were according to truth they nede not fear to let them come to light: for they are a multitude / I am but one: they have and plead against me their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority / I am but a member: they are learned and exercised in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies / the Pastor accounteth me ignorant etc / and so I frely<note n="♣" place="margin">

                        <p n="12">12.

                        <p n="1">1. First Prov. 22.20.21. Where two reasons are given of writing: the one is to show the assurance of the words of truth: the second is / that he may answer the wordes of truth to thē that send to him. And in these behalfes G.I. desiereth writing / first that the truth may ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13951:103"/> year / and be well weighed. 2ly. that when others shall ask or send / he may shew and send them the procedings in truth / and the certainty thereof / when it is vnder both our hands.</p>

                              <p n="2">2. He that meaneth and doth vprightly wil not deny to seeke out and give an vpright writing. Iohn 3.21. 3. writings subscribed wil witnes truth on both sides without partiality. 4. Where long and sundry tro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bles are / many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons also against one their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. Writing stoppeth scoffing etc Men also vse more liberty in speaking then they will do in writing. 6. It gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth equity to both barries.</p>
                           </note>2. A second ground and proofe is. Eccles. 12.10. Where it is said that the Preacher soght an vpright writing or (as the original is) a writing in vprightnes. From which place we learn that we may seeke a writing in vprightnes: And surely in a controversy / wherein I have bene so long threatned with the censure / yea the highest / even excommunication / I am persuaded that it is my duety to seeke a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in vprightnes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third ground is / Acts. 15.2. to 31. Where we finde in the controversy / that there was as speach / so also letters written to the Churche / and the Church referred to both: namely the letters / and the messengers. Now our case being not of ability to maintein daily attending for answer from a Church / or to send messengers to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches / if the proceedings be sett down in writing / other Churches to whome I appeall / or another Church whose help I crave / may the better consider of it. And therefore I do desier that both you and I may set down our case / ād the procedings vnder our hāds / that so other Churches may the better try them / iudg them and end thē by the word of God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Fourthly / the matter having bene in hand foure yeares / and first the pastors wife was in sin / then the Pastor ioining with her made himself guilty also / afterward he gott the eldership to him: Now also they have drawn the congregation to them / and are against mee: these things I say considered / I desier to have the proceedings vnder your hands in writing / that so I may have it to witnes the truth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches: Which if you refuse / I appeal to other Churches / and as opportunity serveth / will get the help of some one Church or moe to deal with you herein as God shall gyve abilitye / and meanes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Fiftly I desier writing / because it wil stopp much scoffing / and reviling: for the Pastor and elder Mr. Stud. being both my accusers and iudges / they speak their pleasures / take liverty to scoffe / and cover their scoffing / giving / and scorning in such maner / as I hope they wold be ashamed to set it down vnder their hands / or to suffer it to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mens eies.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A sixt reason is / that the Pastor with the elder being the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for his wife / they speak what words and so largly as they pleas: When I should answer / either I am commaunded silence by my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers / or in one word or other they go about to entrap me: Whereas if there were writing / things might be more directly set downe it being as free for mee / as for them.<note place="margin">7.

<pb facs="tcp:13951:103"/> Pastor learned / and cunning in reasoning / and no doubt by questioning goeth beyond me / and overtaketh me with words / I hope by writing / they would be prevented.

Tim. 2.9. etc. and 1. Pet. 3.3. etc. they are to be censured as appeareth / 2.

                        <p n="8">8. Further / they being many: and sometimes foure or five of thē speaking together / How can I answer them all? How can I escape en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapping?

And in deed the inconveniences are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny / where there is such confusion of speach / and a multitude against one man: And therefore to avoid al these / I desier to have the procedings set down vnder both our hands in writing.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. A ninth reason is / that a man of learning authority or words / may for a time over cary / and over bear a matter of truth / bringing in great shewes for a false matter / if a man onely iudg by the outward speaches / and have them not also in writing / that so he may further try them: for while a man looketh to the Pastors<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2.12.13.

I therefore still desier things to be set in writing with the proofs from the word of God / that so there may he a sure and full weighing of them: That the learning or gifts of men may not overbeare the truth: but they may be discerned / and truth may prevail.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. A tenth reason is that things cannot be so weighed in a sudden speach / as they may / if they be set in writing. And therefore I also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier writing.</p>
